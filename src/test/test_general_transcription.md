I apologize, but the transcription you provided is incomplete and only contains a single fragment of speech. Based on this limited information, I can summarize the main points as follows:

1. The speaker is introducing a new project.
2. The project is described as a "cool, fun-loving shooter multiplayer game."
3. The game was built using Three.js (likely referred to as "three fiber" in the transcription).
4. The speaker used a package called "playroom" to integrate multiple functionalities into the game.

However, without more context or a complete transcription, it's difficult to provide a more comprehensive summary or additional details about the project.
